Game Instructions:
The goal of the game is to get to your total score to 100 points in the least amount of turns!
At the start of each turn, you will roll two dice with 6 sides each.
If you roll doubles, your turn is over and you gain no points.
If you roll any other combination of numbers, that sum gets added to your points!
After you roll, you can choose to roll again or hold.
If you hold, your turn is over and you keep any points you won that turn.
You can roll again as many times as you'd like, as long as you don't roll doubles.

Expected output/how to run:
1) Run the program. A screen with instructions will appear, once you have read
   the instructions you can enter '1' into the terminal to start the game
2) Once the game is running, it will show a screen with "This Roll:" at the top,
   as well as three other numbers representing the points you've gained that turn, 
   the number of turns you've taken, and the total score. 
3) In the terminal, you will be prompted to either roll or hold 
   (Your answer is taken in by entering r or h in the terminal). If you roll,
   two dice with the results of your roll will show in the window and your turn score will update.
4) You will be prompted to roll or hold again, and your turn will continue until you either hold
   or roll doubles. 
5) You will keep taking turns until you win. When you win, the window will show a new screen that
    congratulates you and tells you how many turns you won in.
